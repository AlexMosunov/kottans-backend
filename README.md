## Git and Github

These learning materials helped me to improve my knowledge about version control. Course provides us with a lot of theory fundamentals that are neccesary to understand for a subsequent work as a software developer.

Most of the commands that I learned in section 3 and 4 of the course were new to me. I was surprised by the huge variety of comands that can be implemented in linux terminal. I inted to use most of these commands and work with terminal, for example while working with Git and Github. These courses give a lot of good theoretical knowledge. 

## Git Collaboration

This course allowed me to learn how to collaborate in Github using version control. I explored useful commands such as git pull, git fetch, git merge and many others. I plan to use this knowledge in my future team projects.

Actually, I found these courses to be too complicated for a beginner, especially for someone who is new to Node.js, like me. Though, I gained some practise and had to google a lot!:) I am going to strengthen my knowleddge by further exploring and studying functional programming and node.js.
