Most of the commands that I learned in section 3 and 4 of the course were new to me. I was surprised by the huge variety of comands that can be implemented in linux terminal. I inted to use most of these commands and work with terminal, for example while working with Git and Github. These courses give a lot of good theoretical knowledge.
